## Jot down...
### Step 1 - Reflect on Your Past Month
Before we go forward, we‚Äôve gotta go back to look at the past month
- **Starts with a Quantitative review:**
	- Webpage analytics: Total traffic, unique traffic, bounce rate, average website visits
	- Email analytics: Total subscribers, new subscribers, # emails sent, average email opens and clicks¬†
	- Funnel analytics: Total people who signed up for your funnel, total purchases or consult calls booked (depending on goal/purpose of your funnel), conversion rate of the funnel, open and click rates of the emails
	- Social analytics: Followers and traffic generated from each
- **Qualitative review**
	- Biggest wins from the past month¬†
	- What worked this month
	- What didn‚Äôt work this month
	- Where did new clients and customers come from this month?

### Step 2 ‚Äì Choose a Promotional Focus for the Month
- Choose 1 thing that you want to focus on promoting for the coming month with your content.

### **Step 3 ‚Äì Brainstorm topic**
**Here‚Äôs what to do for the mind-mapping topic-storming technique:**
- Put your promotional focus at the centre of your mind map
- Then in the next layer of boxes ‚Äì come up with 3-4 different angles to approach your offer from
- Then for each of those angles ‚Äì what are specific questions you can answer or topics you can cover?¬†
- Once you‚Äôre finished mind-mapping, it should be apparent which direction to go based on which questions you‚Äôre the most excited about answering. Try to stick with questions all from one angle however for cohesiveness. You can save the other ideas for later

### **Step 4 ‚Äì Fill Out Monthly Calendar**  (Schedule topics ) 
- Get a blank monthly calendar and schedule all topics that are occurring within that specific month.

### **Step 5 ‚Äì Organized an outline of  contents**
- Start to throw in resources to each contents including the content outline to for writer to start writing content.
