# 7 C's of note-making
---
This template takes you through the 7 C's of note-making:

1. Create (C1)
2. Connect (C2)
3. Clarify (C3)
4. Color (C4)
5. Critique (C5)
6. Cite (C6)
7. Curate (C7)

This is a training template.
I don't normally use this template.
I sometimes revisit it to get reminded of valuable prompts.

If you are new to note-making, here is how you should treat it:

1. At first, use it. It is like training wheels on a bike.
2. Get comfortable with note-making. Then stop using it.
3. As needed, revisit it for helpful reminders of valuable prompts.
