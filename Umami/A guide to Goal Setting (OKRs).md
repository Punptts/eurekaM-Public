# A guide to Goal Setting (OKRs)
---
## Jot down...
- [[The OKR Methodology|OKRs]] is a concept for goal setting. Writing an OKR that works starts with **an objective statement that’s actionable, time-bound, and challenging.**,

### What makes a good OKR?
- **Measurable**
	- In order to easily track whether it's successful or failed, the goal should be measurable. 
	- And imagine if you don’t know if you’ve been successful or not..., how will you know if your OKRs were effective? *The core of a good OKR is that it should be measurable.*
- **Challenging**
	- Writing good OKRs is not the time or place for lowered expectations. OKRs should be a challenge — no risk, no reward.
- **Clear**
	-  Every OKR you set needs to be easily understood by your team
- **Consistenly reviewed**
	- If no one remembers your OKRs, it’s going to be pretty difficult to hit them.
