# Anatomy of MOCs

## Jot down...
To overcome this **mental squeeze point** , create a new digital workbench and gather related notes. *That workbench is an MOC*

In your new MOC,
Go through the **colliding phase**. Make sure you do all of the following:

![[The anatomy of MOCs.png]]
  
- _**Cluster**_ ideas/notes together.
    -   Add lines between clusters (add the gaps).
-   _**Chart**_ the empty spaces between clusters (map the gaps).
    -   _**Create**_ a new “thing” note.
    -   _**Create**_ a new “statement” note.
-   _**Collide**_ your ideas.
    -   _**Clarify**_ your note titles.
    -   _**Connect**_ your notes.
    -   _**Cut up**_ a note into two.
    -   _**Combine**_ two notes into one.
    -   _**Cast aside**_ notes that are no longer relevant.
-   _**Categorize**_ the notes in the MOC.

An MOC is considered a space for thinking.
- In such a space we can:
	-   overcome the **mental squeeze point**
	-   maximize quality **thought collisions**
	-   and progressively build ideas
