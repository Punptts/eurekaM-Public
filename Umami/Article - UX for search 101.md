# UX for search 101
---
## Jot down...
Create a good experience on search function is all about matching result. Usually businesses keep their seach feature simple, A seach box inpu for a query with 1 or 2 keywords and basic result page. BUT a discoverability of users are very complex and sometime very tricky.

### ==Key point==
Search box only wasn't enough for user's discoverability journey. Why...? according to https://www.nngroup.com/videos/search-box-vs-navigation/
- _Search requires knowledge of the search space_
- _Search increases memory load_
- _Search has a higher interaction cost than browsing_
- _Specific site search can often work poorly_
- _Users have poor search skills and don‚Äôt know how search works_

According to 5 why above, the recommended search model for an effective search considering users‚Äô different behaviors is a ==balanced between specific search and navigation through browsing.==  = **search** and **browse** 

### Navigation is very important in search feature
It can provide an overall view from what they find. ==Showing upfront content that they can recognize substantially improves usability because it reduces their cognitive load.==

### Successful **Interaction patterns**
Businesses that are search-centered solution recognize that ==search and browsing must be combined to improve user experience==. The solution have 3 aspect
1. ==Federated== : search across all of its content simultaneously through one search query
2. ==Faceted== : The ability to narrow user's options and find what they want (ex: filter)
3. ==Fast== : Related to response times / shortcut or keys for more convenience to take action.

### **Design Patterns**
- ==Autocomplete== : when interface completes the user sentense with possible outcome
- ==Auto-suggest== : when interface provides user options before start typing
- ==Resent searches== : when interface shows user shortcuts with their latest search
- ==Related search== : Provide user different search options that area related to query (may be relationship). Helps implying on less cognitive effort from users.
- ==Paginaiton== : works great when users are looking for something specific
- ==Sorting== : allows users to control which order they want to see the results
- ==Structured Reults== : Structured results pattern is reshaping our results, changing the visualization, and transform the query results on a different form of visualization to help the users to recognize quicker. (Visualizatiion)
- ==Actionable Results== : Understanding what users would like to do with your product results, can shorten a step for many users with a simple shortcut right on the results page.
- ==Unified discovery== : Search across platform
- ==Best first== : The best first pattern may vary depending on the system, interface, and task, but it‚Äôs safe to say that the first results will always drive more attention than the rest of it.
- ==Alternative view== : When the interface provides users different ways for they visualize the content.
