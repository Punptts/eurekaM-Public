## Jot down...
Assembling -> is the process of composing (gathering) similar notes. Not only notes but also some ideas too.

- Gathering notes, ideas and related thought and place them together based on its content category.
- Shuffle your notes/ideas/thoughts around in a way that makes sense to you.
- Remember, this don't have to be a perfect note. Just a process to play around with your existing thought.
