## Jot down...
**Atleast** - not less than; at the minimum
**Exactly** - precisely
**Atmost** - not more than; at the maximum

*What is a probability of each option respectively?*
For exampl, max 5 choice - play with numebr 3
- **Exactly** 3 -> 1 (o o o) = only 1 probability
- **Atleast** 3 -> 1 (o o o) , 2 (o o o o) , 3 (o o o o o) = 3 probability
- **Atmost** 3 -> 1 (o) , 2 (o o) , 3(o o o) = 3 probability
- SUM UP: If want to know their idea and what really matter to them, Atmost is the best option.
