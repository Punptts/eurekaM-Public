# Bitcoin vs Litecoin
---
## Jot down...
Bitcoin and Litecoin feature in the top 20 cryptocurrencies in the world and use similar mechanisms to operate. But, there are 5 key differences between them.

1. Bitcoin is the biggest Crypto In The world
2. Max values are different,
	- BTC = 21 million
	- LTC = 84 million
3. Mining Rewards
	- Back in the day, mining a new block of Bitcoin could fetch miners up to 50 BTC. (halved every 4 years - causes block of Bitcoin mined in 2021 carries a reward of 6.25 BTC)
	- Mining a block of Litecoin, on the other hand, can fetch miners up to 12.5 LTC
4. Bitcoin is Fast, Litecoi nis Faster... This is because of the two reason
	- A new LTC block is generated every 2.5 minutes while it take a 10 minnutes to create a new BTC block.
	- THe Litecoin platform can handle higher transaction volumn than the Bitcoin platform.
5. Match Algorithm
	- Bitcoin uses the Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA-256) hashing algorithm, which is a classic encryption algorithm designed by the NSA in 2001
	- [Litecoin](https://www.bankoncube.com/post/ripple-coin-vs-litecoin-whats-the-difference)¬†uses Scrypt, a key derivation function known to be better than SHA-256. Scrypt was developed by Colin Percival and makes it far more costly to attack a system that makes use of it.
