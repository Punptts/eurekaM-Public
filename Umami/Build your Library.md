## Jot down...
### **What is Library note**
Library is the Top-down (time tested) structure that can quickly use to organize the information. EMERGENCE LEVEL 4

Template : [[My Library]]

### The word Top-down in Library means..?
: Based on the LYT Classicifation System, the system allow you to organize each MOCs into each category they are most likely to belong.
- This is useful when you are a kind of person who like to think about the category and its content.
- The bottom-up is they focus on the bigger picture first.

> A **library** : This can be a time-tested pre-built solution.

### What is meant by pre-build solution?
- At the beginning, we can create aLibrary to be a test space of how our MOCs will be organize. 
- This can be easily done by the LYT Classicifation System, a template that filled with area of interested that already tested overtime.
- Try the template first and then look for which MOCs does matter to you and which doesn't, then just get rid of those junk.
- By the time come, you will only have the strong and powerful MOCs that fits your learning field.
