## Jot down...
Make thing easier for your future self
- Create a map and just list topics that you can think of related to the map and when the time come just converting it into a valuable note.
- By doing this will help make sense of material and navigate it effectively
- *Topics are like cities. Spending time in a new topic is like spending time in a new city. If you have a good sense of the city, you will be able to navigate it much better.*
-  If you have a better map, you will make a better mark. -- Pattern
