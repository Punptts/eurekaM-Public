# Discourse - Category lockdown
---
## Jot down...
### What is Category lockdown
- This plugin allows you to restrict access to topic pages in a category.
- Topics still show up but will redirect into a different link if not a member of "xx group"
- This is a greatway to advertise the activity for a "member-only"
- Example,
	- ![[discourse category lockdown.png]]
- Content appear in every activity such as latest, top, search, new
- It¬†**IS NOT**¬†designed to keep the contents of the category 100% private
### How it work
- Create a category or subcategory for a "member only"
- Create a user group that are allowed to gain access to topics in that category.
