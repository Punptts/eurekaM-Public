# Discourse - Tag vs Category
---
## Jot down...
%%Create table compare tag and category%%
> *SUM UP*
> - The greatest benefit of category is the permissions / add on plugin such as marksolution or vote / rewards for trust level by participating with the category.
> - The greatest benefit of tags is - more fluid - flexible 
> 	- but the permission is not as powerful as category (some limitaiton)

**Category**
- Pros
	- Set permission / roles - Allow badge / rewards
	- Have an approval concept - require moderator approval
	- Support "mark solution" and "vote" plugin
	- Category appearance - can set what to display / how to display topics
	- Able to set banner for each category
	- Can create Topic template</mark for each category
	- Able to set tag group for each category
- Cons
	- Only 2 layers of category are allowed / Categories are limited in depth.
	- Too many categories causes junk in the community - too complex
> 	Take a hard look at the categories you have today. If they don't house specific security settings and have very few posts, then do you really need that category?

**Tags**
- Pros
	- Can do nested tag / grouping.
	- Can create custom tag grouping to use in a specific category.
	- Able to set permission - who can view tag, who can use tag.
	- More fluid and light weight for people to use.
	- Multiple tags can be apply cross category.
	- You can restrict who can tag by trust level.
	- You can restrict tags by category.
	- Tag groups allow you to limit which tags can be used together on a single topic.
	- Parent-child tag relationships allow you to define which tags can be used in conjunction with other tags.
	- Users can view a list of all tags, and filter topics by tag. 
	- There are bulk tools to assign tags to many topics at once and to rename tags when necessary.
- Cons
	- Limit usage (if compare to category)
	- If tag only visible to x -> will other people see content with that tag?  THE ANSWER IS YES!
