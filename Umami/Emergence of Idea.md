# Emergence of Idea
---
## Jot down...


Before we jump up to the "Idea emergence" we must first understand the term [[System thinking]] in order to have a better picture of how our brain classify thing when in thinking state.

*Idea emergence consists of 5 level
- **Level 1** - start from the **Fleeting thought (idea soup)**
	- Such as sources, memories ideas interactions, insights, and anything that we have come across every day.
	- As create new note = bring the idea into life -> 1st level of Idea emergence.
> -   Between convergence (things becoming unified) and divergence (things becoming unique), this is more about divergence.
- **Level 2** - **A unique note and link it to another note** =  "Emergence level 2"
	- Direct relationship are formed, this is a basic of Zettelkasten.
	- Continue to grow connections = system starts to come alive, and naturally evolving.
	- As a number of note grow -> thing become more complex, difficult to navigate betweeen them.
	- Note: When we have a lot of note, limitation is that notes is always at our eyes level -> so we need a bird-eye view to manage these growing relationships.
 >- At this level, there is still more divergence than convergence.
- **Level 3** - **Made higher order notes - MOCs**
	- Higher order note like MOCs serve countless purpose. 
	- Use MOCs to ensure you keep working and developing idea and projects.
	- MOCs are ideation accelerators.
> -   Massive emergence, convergence, and divergence happen here.
- **Level 4** - Linking higher-order notes, **MOCs are linked to MOCs**.
	- Allow to fly around your note library rapidly.
	- Have multiple MOCs that easily communicate within your thought and contribute new value. - A living ecosystem.
> -   Less divergence happens here, but plenty of convergence does.
- **Level 5** - Highest level of your idea emergence = Your home note
	- All roads lead to home
	- The home considered a beginning and also the end.
-   **The Home note is all about Convergence.**
    -   It allows for top-down “Convergent” thinking like navigating and deliberate creating.
    -   It also allows for bottom-up “Convergent” thinking by consolidating new forms of emergence.

*And that is the Idea Emergence.
