# Fluid framework
---
## Jot down...
**Fluid framwork** are non-form substance (like water). Free form and free flow, highly flexible organizing structure. Can use when ever needed.
-  A note can live and link freely. A note can be discovered in as many places as it’s referenced.
- With higher-order notes like MOCs, we can fluidly add any structure, at any time.

*Defining “fluid frameworks” by looking at MOCs*
1.  **Non-destructive** : The notes that are linked within are not affected.
2.  **Non-exclusive** : MOCs don’t limit discoverability
3.  **Non-limiting** : You can create countless variations of structure.
4.  **Co-existing** : MOCs don’t impede other MOCs.
5.  **Heterarchial** : There is no hard-coded, rigid top-down structure.
6.  **Overlapping** : MOCs can link to the same notes, no big deal.
7.  **Augment-able** : MOCs can quickly augment the view of your library.
8.  **Neighborly** : MOCs stay out of the way, unless you need them.
9.  **Delete-able** : You can delete MOCs and your notes remain unaltered (unlike folders).
	-   You’ve lost _value_ but you haven’t lost core _information_ .

10.  **Fluid** : Like water, MOCs can form to the changing shape of your needs
