## My PKM Workflows - Global Guidelines Builder üèó
No matter what tools I use, these are my global guidelines for my PKM workflows.

They are intended to be tool-agnostic and future-proofed.

Each one relates to the other so it is best to look at them all together.

- Practice basic Idea Emergence
	- Reduce the amount of information you attempt to process.
	- Filter the quality of information you encounter.
	- Add good friction.
- Practice radical Idea Emergence
	- Save very little. 
	- Don't schedule a time to process it.
	- Allow relevant stuff will rise to the top.
	- You'll know when it's earned a seat at the table.
	- Your experience has to develop this intuitive feeling. 
	- From the nothingness, externalize it into the somethingness. 
	- While counter-intuitive, this keeps your PKM system a joyful place.
	- *This flies in the face of conventional wisdom.*
- Use antilibraries for curating noise, not for note-making
	- Just because you can capture everything, doesn't mean you should. 
	- But when you do, have a separate area for it. 
	- In your antilibraries:
		- Don't: over-highlight or over-organize
		- Limit: commenting and linking
	- What are common antilibraries?
		- Apps that download or clip web articles.
			- Pocket, Instapaper, Readr, Evernote, DevonTHINK, MarkDownload.
- Minimize note-taking to maximize note-making
	- The most value is generated in the note-making.
- Connect your wants with your actions
	- Your wants and actions will change over time. 
	- Make sure your goals remain in alignment with your actions. 
	- Go to your [[I want to...]] note and align your goals with clear PKM actions.
	- Change your "I want to..." note as needed to keep yourself in alignment. 
- Don't over-structure
	- Over-structuring fails because: 
		- It won't be earned structure ([[Gall's Law]]).
		- It won't be future-proof ([[Antifragility]]).
		- It prevents Idea Emergence from working for you.
- Build cognitive scaffolding instead
	- This may seem counter-intuitive, but building thing notes and statement notes doesn't add rigidity or noise. Instead, it makes it easier to develop insights while naturally fueling Idea Emergence.
- Avoid hyper-specific workflows
	- Every step you glue together is a potential point of failure. Hyper-specific workflows are not [[Antifragility|Antifragile]], they are hyper-fragile. 
- Let Idea Emergence work for you
	- Too much noise silences the signal.
	- Too much structure suffocates the system.
	- Too much workflow paralyzes the practice.
