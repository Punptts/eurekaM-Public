## Jot down...
Understanding [[The paradigms of notes]] and answer yourself, what note is making of, how note work, and what can we do with those note.

In order to get the right method for your notes to be alive, you need to understand of ways that note can identify first.

### Type of notes
###### Zombie VS Living notes
**Zombie notes**
- The most common zombie notes are web-clipped articles
> **Zombie notes** are unlinked, unloved, and ever-lingering.

**Living notes**
- Notes can change and evolve
> **Living notes** are linked, loved, and ever-evolving.

###### Note-taking VS Note-making
**Note-taking**
- Passive thinking
- “Churn and burn”
- Static & permanent notes

**Note-making**
- Active thinking
-  “Know and grow”
- Living & evergreen notes

###### Evergreen notes VS permanent notes
Don't make permanent notes -> make evergreen : The big takeaway: _**If notes can’t evolve and mature, they won’t be as valuable.

**Characteristic of evergreen notes**
- Clear and concise - The title for evergreen notes should be a clear title or statement.
- Your own words - Writing in your own words forces you to deeply think about what you’re trying to say.
- Linked - Your living, evergreen notes should have links to other notes.
- Non-static - As you encounter new things in life, you can re-write or re-factor your notes to capture more meaning and value.

###### Thing notes and statement notes
Thing notes = noun, a thing
Statement notes = combine things together + opinion = form a statement 

Sometimes _things_ generate _statements_ .  
Other times _statements_ generate _things_ .

This is the LYT way: sensemaking through note-making!
