## Jot down...
### Define Job to be Done
**A job to be done is best defined as a PERSPECTIVE.** 
: It is considered a lens through which you observe the market, customer segments, user's needs, and competitors differently and make an innovation that fits the predicable behavior.

**JOBS-TO-BE-DONE THEORY**
: is comprised of a group of principles or tenets that form a foundation for making marketing more effective and innovation more predictable by focusing on the customer‚Äôs job-to-be-done. The theory is based on the notion that people buy products and services to get a ‚Äújob‚Äù done.

> When Einstein engaged in his thought experiments, he pictured himself riding on a beam of light and traveling through the universe. From this perspective he was able to view the universe through a new lens, enabling him to see things in a different and meaningful way and to develop a theory that others could not.
