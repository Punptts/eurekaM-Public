# Junior Designer's mind
---
## Jot down...
It is possible for a junior designer to think strategically from time to time like a lead designer, those thoughts need time to practice.

### Junior Designers
- Passive mindset, just tell me what you want.
- Junior designers tend to wait for others to pull the trigger.
- The scope in their mind is fixed on the specific task given to them.
- Their primary motivation at worDk is what psychologists term a [[reward sustem]] 
*Typical mindset*
- “I have to do this user testing here because this is a standard industrial approach I learned from school”.
- “I have to do this, or I won’t get my paycheck”.
- “That’s not what I’m paid to do.”
*Typical Activities*
- Quietly and silently sits in the back seat during a meeting and no question is raised until it’s directly related to the task right by their hand.
- Rarely suggests or plans anything new about next step activities.
- Afraid to ask questions.
- Wait for things to happen. Do not seek opportunities to grow intentionally.
*Achievements they highlighted*
- Every single design research methodology they can think of
- A long list of design thinking methods they used for a particular project
- Graphic design experience (“I designed the 404 page”)
