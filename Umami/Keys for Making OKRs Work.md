# 7 Key Tenets for Making OKRs Work
---
## Jot down...
OKRs may seem simple on the surface.., but that doesn't mean they are easy to implement... In order to make it work, should take these 7 keys into consideration.
- **Less is more**
	- Doerr recommends 3-5 key results per objective only.
- **Set goals from the bottom up**
	- ¬†Teams and individuals should set about half of their own OKRs in consultation with their managers, rather than all goals coming from the top.
	- As management expert [[Peter Drucker]] observed ‚ÄúWhen people choose a course of action, they‚Äôre more likely to see it through.‚Äù
- **No dictating (‡∏ö‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£ / order)**
	- Even high-level, top-down OKRs set by company leaders should be arrived at through a collaborative. A collective agreement is essential for success.
- **Stay flexible**
	- OKRs are meant to be agile in response to changing according to a circumstances.
- **Set ‚Äústretched‚Äù goals**
	- REMEMBER : You shouldn‚Äôt achieve 100% of your OKRs, keep it chellenging. Google famously aims for a 60-70% success rate.
	- A 100% success rate means you played it too safe with your targets. 
	- OKRs should stretch you, your team, and/or your company beyond what you‚Äôre currently capable of.
	- If you feel uncomfortable with yout OKRs mean you did it right!
- **Never tie OKRs to monetary incentives
	- Doerr makes clear that for OKRs to work, they must remain separate from compensation.
	- Once key results are tied to bonuses and promotions, people have an incentive to play it safe.
- **Be patient**
	- Setting OKRs is hard.
	- The flexible, trial-and-error mentality behind setting OKRs applies equally to the process of applying the system itself.
