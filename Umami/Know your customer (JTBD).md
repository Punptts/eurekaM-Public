### The insight of Job to be Done
*Job to be done*
- Now's day, Innovatio has been a top priority -- for leaders.
- In a recent McKinsey poll, 84% of global executives reported that innovation was extremely important to their growth strategies, but there are around 94% of people were dissatisfied with their organizations‚Äô innovation performance.
- Thanks to the big data revolution, companies now can collect an enormous variety and volume of customer information, at a very high speed and good for analytical.
- Most firm have established structure, innovation and hired people with a very talented skiled to run them but for most of them .. innovation is still "painfully hit-otmiss"

### What hash gone wrong...?
- Most of the masses of customer data companies create is **structured to show correlations**
- Though analysing data from numbers are well known for many years "numbers not lied" BUT still it doesn't mean that one thing actually cause another.
- While marketers collect demographix or phychographic information about him and campare to other buyers - not going to capture those reason.

##### Example
> For example, Consider the case of one of this article‚Äôs coauthors, Clayton Christensen. He‚Äôs 64 years old. He‚Äôs six feet eight inches tall. His shoe size is 16. He and his wife have sent all their children off to college. He drives a Honda minivan to work. He has a lot of characteristics, but none of them has caused him to go out and buy the New York Times. His reasons for buying the paper are much more specific. He might buy it because he needs something to read on a plane or because he‚Äôs a basketball fan and it‚Äôs March Madness time.

### Conclusion
- **Focus on correlation**‚Äîand on knowing more and more about customers‚Äîis taking firms in the wrong direction.
- What they really need to home in on is the progress that the customer is trying to make in a given circumstance‚Äîwhat the customer hopes to accomplish. This is what we‚Äôve come to call the _job to be done._
- The theory of jobs to be done was developed in part as a complement to **the theory of disruptive innovation**‚Äîwhich at its core is about competitive responses to innovation

>The focus on knowing more about customers has taken firms in the wrong direction.

### Bonus
DISRUPTION THEORY is not actually a point to innovate the company because this doesn't help create p/s that customer want to buy, instead... its about **Jobs-to-be-done theory** this helps transform our **understanding of customer choice** in a way that data ever could.
