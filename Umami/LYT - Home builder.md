## Wall 1 - Add MOCs 
### Use the PKM planet survey to spark ideas for your home note

- Idea-driven = [[My PKM MOC]], Special areas of yours
- Output-driven = Writings MOC, Makings MOC
- Productivity-driven = Projects MOC, Goals MOC
- Improvement-driven = Flowcreation MOC

- Like the home note, it can also act as a launchpad into the various 

## Wall 4 - Add you
*Add things that are uniquely you*

Make the home note your own unique note because *"you are you, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is you-er than you."* There is no reason to make the home note a cold, sterile place. You might just start to avoid it. Instead, it can be a place of calm or joy‚Äîor at least mild appreciation.
