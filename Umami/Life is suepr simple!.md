## Jot down...
Everyone has their problems. Some might have more significant problems, some might have small problems... But the real big problem is "Over thinking".

One problem most people have, regardless of any outside factor, is that they overcomplicate these problems. But actually life is super simple,

1. If you want to change your mood — Exercise
2. If you want to be calmer — Meditate
3. If you want to understand yourself — Journal
4. If you want to understand the world — Read
5. If you want to see progress/growth — Be Consistent
