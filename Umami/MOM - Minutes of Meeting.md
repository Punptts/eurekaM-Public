# MOM - Minutes of Meeting
---
## Jot down...
**Minutes of meeting** are the notes that take throughout the meeting. Notes are included Key points, participants involve, the solution and etc.

### Content of the MOM
- Data and time of the meeting
- Name of attendees + absend participants
- Acceptance of, or any improve from the previous meeting
- Decision made on each item on the agenda
- Key takeaway of the meeting
- Future course of action (Task from this meeting)

This reminds me of the time whan I have a lot of meeting in a day, most of us likely to spend too much time on unnecessary meeting. It is very important for the people who arrange the meeting to invite only relatable participants to join.

Let's create template for MOM and use as a main template for Meeting notes.
