## Jot down...
### Relationship between Notes
- **Major relationship builder**
	- *Note* are people 
	- *Links* are strong relationship
	- *Tags* are weak relationship
	- *MOCs* are like being in the same team, learning and growing from each other, lean on each other.
	- *Proximity* are people on the same flight—you might be with family, or friends, or your team—but you might also be with a total group of strangers too.
-
- **Direct link** = strongest type of relationship
	- Pros: Flat stucture notes, firctionless, focus on relevance
	- Cons: Using only link is messy and overwhelming
	- It just keep you at an eye-level in "Emergence level2"

### Relationship with folders
- **Folder dominant**
	- Folder are silo information and rigid hierarchy - order based.
	- By using folder = forced into thinking from a top-doen perspective. This is good for organizing BUT bad  for general thinking
	- IF we think of folder first cons will be,
		- Block the ability to think
		- Spend more time asking which folder
		- Stunt the long-term frowth of complex digital library
- **Ways to use folder**
	- Folder for daily notes
	- Folder for projects
	- Folder for inbox
	- Folder for special files
	- Fodler for "Clear define type note" e.g. the one you share with others
	- Folder for sources
	- Folder for MOCs
	- Folder for private notes

### Relationship with tags
Tags are weak... but [[Tags are useful when tools are great]]
- **Make tags stronger**, note application needs 3 things
	- **Auto-updating tags** - easity change / rename tags
	- A**uto-completing tags** - suggestion
	- **Nested tags** - nested tag in category
- **Way to use tags**
	- Tags by topic - messy
	- Tags the status - still have to maintain  
	- Tag projects - such as tag project status
	- Tag spaces - such as work space, personal space
	- Tag by noun - such as meeting, people, output, source
	- Tag for chronological sorting
	- Tag for exclusion - tags to filter out result
	- Tag for queries and filter
	- Tags for emergence (idea and thought) - tags first -> when it "rise to the top" crate new value by making MOC out of it.
- **Pros and Cons**
	- Pro: tags help filtering large notes. A Fluid framework. One note multiple tag
	- Cons: May cause multiple similar tags - advise to use all singular tag.

### Relationship with proximity
- **Proximity make relationsbpos between notes in 2 ways**
	- Random - one note next to another note by random
	- Intentional - one note next to another note by intentional
- **There are 3 types of proxomity** (note order sort by...)
	- Alphabetical
	- Chronological
	- Topical

### Relationship with MOCs
- **MOC = special type of notes : has properties of folders and tags**
	- Folder-like: MOCs assemble notes in a tightly-packed grouping.
	- Tag-like: MOCs group the links of associated notes in a non-exclusive way. (The notes themselves live freely elsewhere.)
	-   Proximity: MOCs grant you the ability to deliberately position each note in relation to the other notes.
- Analogies for MOCs
	- MOCs is like a warehouse full of workbenches
	- It is a "room where it happens"
	- MOCs are sometime mature evergreen notes.
- Different between MOCs and TOCs 
	- MOC are fluid - TOC are rigid

### Relationship with Home note
- Think of your Home note as the highest-level of your digital notes.
- Links to the main MOCs in your library
- It is an excellent access point because it encourages you to focus on the areas in your life that you’ve deemed as important.
