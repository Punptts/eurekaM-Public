Navigate your library of maps with a classification system made for PKM. 

### The LYT Classification System
A lightly modified from the Cutter, Dewey, and Universal Decimal classification systems used in libraries around the world. It will provide you a time-tested foundation as you structure the interests of your digital library.

## Commentary
Please don't go overboard with numbering things. We‚Äôre just using a basic pre-made map as a fixed *spatial constellation* upon which to easily add dots of new interests. Too much structure stifles innovation and organic, emergent growth.
