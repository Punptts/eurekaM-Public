# Note taker vs note maker
---
## Jot down...
- **Note taker** - only focus on hilighting other people notes. Not actually note owner - no real value.
- **Note maker** - have a "always developing" mindset. Read note to create another real value
- Create valuable notes + consistant + time = radical value created - like the concept of compound interest
- Lingkong your thinking.
