## Jot down...
### Old learning habits,
- Re-reading, highlighting, undrlying -> Researh show that this is just a quick fitxed, just for short-term. But in long-term we loose value.
- Familliarity and recall are different, they process in 2 different part of the brain and that's why it create illusion for people to to misunderstand about how they know the informations.
- Familliar with information *not equal* to able to recall the information.
- Our brain naturally works - study habit -> learning habit -> thinking habit

### Multi-step highlighting technique
- Identify misguide techniques
	- They encourage capturing large amount of information
	- They encourage multiple step of very basic note taking such as bolding, highlighing, and hilighting the highlight and etc. - no value
-  And, following with 3 danger habits
	- Over collecting
	- Under thinking by over highlighing
	- Unique output
- Lead to make your digital library burry with some over summarize and snippets which not create any value by it self over time.
- Capturing somehing with a click of the mosue = give us an illusion that we are effectively managing knowledge. 
- The truth is we just want to manage our knowledge - [[FOMO]]

### Over colleciton
- Over collecting without processing
- Saving many article -> and processing few
- why capture those in the first place if no quality?

### Under-thinking by over-highlighting
- How we underthink when over highlight?
	- When in highlighting mode prevent use from developing our own perspective from the idea we encounter with.
	- Reduce our ability to think and connect idea
	- Limits amount of value we can create

### Simple Solution
- Not to save so much noise in the first place.
- But before we recognize the noise, we have to recognize the real problem first.
- *A healty relationship with knowledge*
	- Based on intricsic motivation
	- Having a dialog with the idea you capture
	- Build better km habits - be more on note-maker.
