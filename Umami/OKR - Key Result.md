## Jot down...
**Key Results should be:  
- **Describe how you’ll get there**, or the actions you’ll take to accomplish an objective
- **Time-bounded** – should be completed by the end of the cycle
- **Concrete and measurable** – at the end of the period, you must be able to say “I did or did not accomplish this result”. Should evaluated and evolved throughout the cycle
- Key resultes should be measurable, realistic, and a refleciton of your team.
-  **Should have 3-5 per Objectives**
