	- Concrete & action-oriented, but may or may not be objectively measurable
-   **Time-bound**: Should set a scope of time, start and ending
	- Aren‚Äôt a strict time-bounded ‚Äì can rollover quarter to quarter or even year to year
-   **Ambitious**: Should be challenging (neither too difficult nor easy)
	-  Inspirational ‚Äì should connect back to your overall mission and why you do what you do
