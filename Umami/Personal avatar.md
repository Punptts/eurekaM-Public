## Jot down...
When joining the club, you get to create your own avatar which grows depending on your activity. This is one of the most critical aspects of gamification, alongside with the community.

*An avatar that ‚Äúgrows‚Äù can boost your motivation*
- Research suggests that using an avatar enhanced by points that are gained from your level of activity is useful. Even without research, 10 million active users of Wolrd of Warcraft will prove that (or any other MMO game).
