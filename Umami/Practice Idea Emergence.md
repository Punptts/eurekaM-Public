# Practice Idea Emergence
---
## Jot down...
We have the most control of the information at a point where we encouter new information, 
- What to filter out
- What to take the extra effort to save for later
- What to process in a moment

The Idea Emergence allow you to go from the nothingness -> to the somehtingness, complexity of link and meaningful value. 

### Practice Idea Emmergence
We always practice some form of idea emergence we just don't know that well. Focus on the 3 major dials,
- **Reduce the amount**
	- Reduce the amount of information you encounter and attempt to consume. This will prevent becoming overwhelmed from “information overload”.
- **Filter for quality**
	- Filter the quality of information you encounter.
	- Use a mixture of your _**intentions, taste, critical thinking, and curiosity**_ to guide you
- **Add good friction**
	- Ensure the information you spend time with is actually valuable _**to you**_ .
	- Set up an environment where ideas have to earn their entrance into your note-making space, then you’ve created _**good friction**_.
