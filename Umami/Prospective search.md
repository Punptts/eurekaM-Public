## Jot down...
**Prospective search** or **persistent search** is a method of [searching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_technology) which determines which of a set of queries matches content.

-   Retrospective search starts by gathering the information, indexing it, then letting users query the information. The results don't change until the index is rebuilt.
-   Prospective search starts with the user's queries, gathers the information in a targeted way, indexing it and then providing the results as they arrive.
