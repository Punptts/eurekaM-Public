## Jot down...
> Decay - means decline/spoil over time

**The reputation decay** is kind of like a point system that when user's reputation is reach the minimum (eg. 70%) then the reputation point will start to decay 1% overtime. 

This is reminds me of a human behavior that happen when the pain of losing is twice powerful as gains or when an individual tends to prefer avoiding losses knwon as [[Loss Aversion]].

According to Reputation Decay,
: Instead of deducting the point, just try to create some rules to support the reputation decay system. This strategy could help people value points and tend to be active to save their points instead of feeling bad about losing them.

The key is to make people feel positive of saving their reputation point.
