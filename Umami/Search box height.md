## Jot down...
### assumption 1
The [Nielsen] study found that the **average search box is 18-characters wide**

The data showed that 27% of queries were too long to fit into it. **Extending the box to 27 characters would accommodate 90% of queries**

**Sum up**

-   Average size = 18-characters wide
-   Best suite (accommodate 90%) for all type of queries = 27-charaters

### assumption 2
It depends!

I work for a recipe site and we launched a new site last year which had a whole redesign. We used to have a smaller search box and users interacted with it completely differently to a larger one.

I think this is because :

-   Users could see everything they were typing and that seemed important to them.
-   Since the box was wider, it meant that people could type more, but it did not stop users from typing less.

**Sum up**

-   Bigger is better
    -   Allow user to type more - what’s in their mind
    -   Bigger doesn’t mean to stop use to type less
-   By design the box bigger = create a feeling of getting more option for user

### assumption 3
-   Average length of expected search terms : The visible character capacity of the input will influence behavior.
-   Desired visual prominence of the search feature : The size of the input impacts more than the number of characters entered.
