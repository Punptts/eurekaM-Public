### Jot down
- What is Proof of Keys
	- _Proof of Keys_ is a movement started by well-known crypto investor [Trace Mayer](https://medium.com/u/75e93b5827c9?source=post_page-----c457e6589e8d--------------------------------) through Twitter. On Thursday, January 3rd, 2019 investors are being urged to move their cryptocurrency _off_ of exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, etc.) and _into_ a Bitcoin wallet where they have control over the private keys.
- Why January 3rd?
	- January 3rd, 2019, is the 10-year anniversary of the Bitcoin _‘_[_genesis block_](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block)_’_ being mined. _Proof of Keys_ is intended to become an annual tradition so a date that’s easy to remember, as it celebrates the creation of the Bitcoin blockchain, was chosen.
- what’s the point of Proof of Keys?
	- As Trace Mayer stated in his tweet, “Not your keys; not your bitcoin.” Most crypto veterans, but far too few nocoiners (er… newcomers), understand that cryptocurrency stored on an exchange is, technically, owned by that exchange. Since the exchange has full control over the private keys (users have no access to them) they have the ability to do whatever they choose with the wallets and the crypto stored in them.
