### Jot down
What is Mainnet and Testnet?
> During the 2017 ICO Phase, people FOMOâ€™d and invested in projects having only white papers. Some of these projects boasted high outputs and performance results. However, many of them showcased such claims in testnet environments only.*

Testnet
- A testnet (Test Network) is an experimental network where developers can test, create, or modify functionalities and monitor the blockchain network performance.

Mainnet
- AÂ [mainnet](https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/tag/mainnet/)Â (Main Network) is the final, most stable, and fully functional version of the blockchain.
- Mainnets enable dApps to be launched for public use. They see an increased number of validators who are incentivized by tokens with real value. All transactions are live on the mainnet.
