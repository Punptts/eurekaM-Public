## Jot down...
**System thinking** is when our brain starts to understand what is happening beneath the surface of our thought.

As we use links in our notes
-> interesting pattern start to form.

1. Emergence - formation of collective behavior / adding complexity
2. Complexity - many units of information link together form complexity
3. Divergence - basically when things become unique
4. Convergence - basically when things become unified (strongly combined)

*Why does it matter ?
- To understand of how individual works in order to create the best possible processes to accomplish just about anything.
