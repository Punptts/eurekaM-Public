## Jot down...
Tags are not dumb. They’re weak.
And in their weakness is a strength far greater than we can easily imagine…
But for tags to be strong, your note application needs to do three things.

1.  **Auto-updating tags** : You can easily change `#books` to `#book` in all of your notes.
2.  **Auto-completing tags** : You can just type a couple letters to get a list of suggested tags.
3.  **Nested tags** : To effectively manage tags, you can “nest” them in categories.
