# Tags are useful when tools are great

## Jot down...
As a reminder, your PKM tool should be able to do the following with tags:
-   **Auto-updating tags** : You can easily change `#books` to `#book` in all of your notes.
-   **Auto-completing tags** : You can just type a couple letters to get a list of suggested tags. This helps tremendously with recall.
-   **Nested tags** : To effectively manage tags, you can “nest” them in categories.
