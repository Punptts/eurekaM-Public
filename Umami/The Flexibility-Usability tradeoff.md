# The Flexibility-Usability tradeoff
---
## Jot down...

**As the flexibility of a system increases, its usability decreases.**

[Flexible designs](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flexibility-efficiency-heuristic/) support more functions and satisfy a wider set of requirements, but they perform those functions less efficiently than specialized tools.

When balancing flexibility versus usability, consider how well the needs of the users are understood, and how likely they are to evolve or change. Flexible products come with significant costs in terms of complexity, usability, adoption time, and investment requirements.
