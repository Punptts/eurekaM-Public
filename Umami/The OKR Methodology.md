**OKR - Objective Key Result** 
Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is the goal-setting tool used by the likes of IBM, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Dropbox, Spotify, Disney, and BMW to get thousands of employees moving toward the same ambitious goals.

- [[OKR - Objective]] : The objective referred to a goal what you want to avhieve, and the key results are the waks or milestones that you have to do step by step to achieve the goals.
- [[OKR - Key Result]] : Key resultes should be measurable, realistic, and a refleciton of your team.

Note that,
- Your OKRs should be reliant on your team's top priorities. 

[[Doerr]] describes objectives and key results as the yin and yang of goal setting. Without key results to make them actionable, objectives are just wishes. Without objectives to ground them in a higher strategy and purpose, key results are just a directionless to-do list.
