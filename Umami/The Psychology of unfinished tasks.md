# The Psychology of unfinished tasks
---
## Jot down...
We're often told to finish what we start. Some people even say that you should never start what you're not committed to finish.

BUT THIS IS NONSESNE...

Psychological research shows that we can benefit from not finishing what we start, as long as we don't ignore those unfinished tasks for too long.

Unfinished task can feel overwhelm but at the same time, having these unfinished task can also tackle the next opportunity...

These contradictory experiences are dus to 2 effects,
- [[The Zeigarnik effect]]
- [[The Ovsiankina effect]]
