---
## Jot down...
In 1927, psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik [reported](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-020-01033-5) that individuals tend to have a better memory for tasks that are interrupted or incomplete, than they do for tasks that have been completed.

The relationship between Task and Memory.

"Zeigarnik and her supervisor, professor Kurt Lewin, observed that their restaurant waiter had an exceptional memory for what everyone at the table had ordered, despite never writing anything down.

However, it later emerged that he only retained the information until each table left."

From the experinemt, the result shows that it possible for the human memory to distinguish between task that have been completed and those that are still left to complete.

As a result, human being tend to remember unfinished tasks better. this phenomenon become known as the Zeigarnik effect.
