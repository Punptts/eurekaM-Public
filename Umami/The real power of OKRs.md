# The real power of OKRs
---
## Jot down...
**Focus**
- OKR creates a clear understanding of what needs to be prioritized
- Give team permisison to says no to any thing else (focus on OKRs only)

**Alignment**
- The beaty of OKRs is that they's re both top-down and bottom-up approach to goal setting.
- While the company sets high-level, strategic OKRs (top down), teams and individuals are empowered to define their own OKRs (in consultation with their managers) to best meet the company‚Äôs goals (bottom up)
- They then own that specific piece of work.

**Accountability (be responsible)**
- Clear deadlines create urgency, objective measurement removes subjectivity, and regular check-ins ensure that prompt action is taken.
- In the age of knowledge works, where output is often difficult to measure and define, OKRs can be used as a mutual agreement upon what's working, what's blocking, and what need to change

**Growth**
- OKRs can be a powerful tool that help individual or team to stay motivated and also force its stretch  to encourage the to perform beyonf their current abilities.
- Setting *OKRs should make you feel uncomfortable* - while uncomfortable, at the same time, you will fail and learn from it naturally as a part of the process
