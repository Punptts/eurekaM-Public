# Thought Collisions
---
## Jot down...
**Thought collisions** is the process of converting light bulb moments (the illusion) into a few more spark to fly around. 

*As particle collide*
- some merge into a new powerful article
- some breakdown apart to more fundamental elements.

**Maximized your thought collision**
To maximized = to make your thought interact with other thought. 
- Make related thought talk to each other.
- Create an effective thinking system.

MOC helps to maximized frequency, quality and reliability for thoght collisions
