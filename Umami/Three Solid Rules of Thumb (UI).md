# Three Solid Rules of Thumb (UI)
---
## Jot down...
We can’t necessarily control the absolute complexity of a system, but what we can control is how we abstract these complexities from the users within various work roles.

There are many approaches which can be used to make this happen, but let’s talk about these three rules of thumb:

### Rationality
- Ask question : _→ “Does this approach make sense?”_
- Your user is going to have to work with this thing, ideally frequently, so you want to make sure that whatever you do makes good sense to them and does not increase their cognitive load by making them think too much.
- **So ask yourself:** does this approach really, truly make sense?

### Functionality
- Ask question : _→ “Does this approach deliver the outcomes that your users really need?”_
- Users have the expectation that if a feature is present within your interface, that it be functional. You want to make sure that every feature set is functional, and that every piece of functionality has a deliberate purpose within the interface.
	- If it doesn’t need to be there, remove it.
	- If it is extraneous in any way, remove it.
	- [If there are duplicate features, remove them](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/duplicate-links/).

### Feasibility
- Ask question : _→ “Does this approach translate well to development?”_
- Generally speaking, most common UI components aren’t going to be an issue. What can cause problems, however, are custom interface components that have very specific things that they are trying to do.

### Bringing it all together
-   **Rationality** _→ “Does this approach make sense?”_
-   **Functionality** _→ “Does this approach deliver the outcomes that your users really need?”_
-   **Feasibility** _→ “Does this approach translate well to development?”_
