# Time value of ideas

## Jot down...
### Time value of idea concept
Time value of idea place a similar concept with time value of money
- The concept is that money we get today is more value than what we will get in future (within the same amount) due to these reason
	- **Certainty** - You get idea for sure (clipping articles seems like a safe way to get thing, But what we really get from this is a noise)
	- **Optionality** - You can use the idea right now
	- **Leverage** - You can leverage the idea to make more insights

### The 4 basics phase of PKM workflow
- Collecting phase - get the new stuff
- Hightlighting Phase - bold note
- Development Phase - ask question, combine the stuff
- Cretion Phase - come up with something (My stuff) / non original final product
.
**Spend time better on new stuff with [[Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] practices combined with LYt - Idea Emergence method.**
- *Time should spent on each phase*
	- Collection phase 15%
	- Extracting phase 15% 
		- Extract: we can extract and make value with the phase and engage with activity = active.
		- Highlight: It is just bold the phase = passive.
	- Development phase 55%
	- Creation phase 15%

By using an above time spend - sum up
-  Spend less time on collection -> because we not create any value in that phase
- Focus more on devleopment phase -> play information with idea
