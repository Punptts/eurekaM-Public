### Interaction patterns
- Businesses that are search-centered solution recognize that search and browsing must be combined to improve user experience. The solution have 3 aspect
1. ==Federated==(combine): search across all of its content simultaneously through one search query
2. ==Faceted== : The ability to narrow user's options and find what they want (ex: filter)
3. ==Fast== : Related to response times / shortcut or keys for more convenience to take action.

### Design patterns
- ==Autocomplete== : when interface completes the user sentense with possible outcome
- ==Auto-suggest== : when interface provides user options before start typing
- ==Recent searches== : when interface shows user shortcuts with their latest search
- ==Related search== : Provide user different search options that area related to query (may be relationship). Helps implying on less cognitive effort from users.
- ==Paginaiton== : works great when users are looking for something specific
- ==Sorting== : allows users to control which order they want to see the results
- ==Structured Reults== : Structured results pattern is reshaping our results, changing the visualization, and transform the query results on a different form of visualization to help the users to recognize quicker. (Visualizatiion)
- ==Actionable Results== : Understanding what users would like to do with your product results, can shorten a step for many users with a simple shortcut right on the results page.
- ==Unified discovery== : Search across platform
- ==Best first== : The best first pattern may vary depending on the system, interface, and task, but it‚Äôs safe to say that the first results will always drive more attention than the rest of it.
- ==Alternative view== : When the interface provides users different ways for they visualize the content.
