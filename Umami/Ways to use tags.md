# Ways to use tags
---
## Jot down...
- *Tag by topic or description* - add a tag to¬†describe¬†something.
	- such as `#on/pkm` `#on/habit`
- *Tag the status* - This works for some people, and for others it becomes ‚Äúyet another thing I have to maintain‚Äù
	- such as `#todo` `#doing` `done`
	- emergence like `#seedbox` `#sapling` `#evergreen`
- *Tag projects* - Instead of trying to tag every note with a status, you might decide to only put a status on projects
	- such as `#project/active` `#project/soon`
- *Tag spaces* - Your life stuff and your career (or business) stuff
	- such as `#meetings` `#people`
- *Tag by noun* - about things
	- such as `#output` `#people` `#meeting` `#question` `#quote`
- *Tag for chronological sorting*
	- such as `#meeting` click on tag and show all notes in chronological order.
- *Tag for exclusion* - You could use a tag as more of an ‚Äúanti-tag‚Äù that you filter out of your searches.
- *Tag for queries and filters* - For power users who want to create all sorts of queries and filters. Help create fancy automation.
- *Tag for emergence* - Over time, certain tags will ‚Äúrise to the top‚Äù (grow in number).

*A valuable area upon which to make into an MOC or related output*
