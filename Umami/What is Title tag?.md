## Jot down...
**Quick Note:** Title tags are also often called Page Titles. You might also hear them referred to as Website Titles or HTML titles.

It considered a clickable title of a web page that appear on the SERP (search engine page results page)

```

<head> <br/> <title>This is My Title</title><br/></head><br/><br/><br/>

```

Since Google will only be able to display 60-70 characters of a page title in the results, you should aim to make your SEO titles around 60 characters long. Clear title tags will go a long way towards making your website easy to read and understand.
