# Why do developers name their home page index.HTML

## Jot down...
By convention, most web servers are configured to serve the file named index.html

If you request the contents of a folder on the web server and that folder contains a file named index.html.

Some web servers are configured to look for alternate files such as home.html, start.html, and even files with other extensions like index.php, index.cgi, etc.
