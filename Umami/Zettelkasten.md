###### Keys takeaway
Zettelkasten zealots are likely to experience two pitfalls in their PKM efforts:
-   Making **atomic notes** that are too tiny = fragmented thinking.
-   Making **permanent notes** that are too static = a non-evolving PKM system.

 Evergreen notes are a digital evolution of the “atomic” and “permanent” notes
