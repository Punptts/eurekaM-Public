# Be Creative Under Pressure
---
## Jot down...
- Creativity and pressure don't really get along together. The pressure gun always kills creativity. (https://quotefancy.com/quote/1475611/Tiger-Woods-I-always-feel-pressure-If-you-don-t-feel-nervous-that-means-you-don-t-care)

> ‘I always feel pressure. If you don’t feel nervous, that means you don’t care about how you play. I care about how I perform. I’ve always said the day I’m not nervous playing is the day I quit.’

- **If you treat a pounding heart as a means of excitement instead of anxiety, you can harness the creative energy in any unfavorable pressure situation.**

- Instead of getting too involved in thinking about “hows,” detach yourself from the situation. Pretend that you’re working for someone else. Act as if you’re thinking for someone else. Think that someone else is going to be benefitted from your creativity.

- The moment you detach yourself from the scene, fear of failure will reduce. Your anxiety will alleviate.
