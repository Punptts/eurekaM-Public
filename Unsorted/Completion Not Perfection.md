Think About Completion, Not Perfection

> Writers mostly get sucked into the black hole of writer’s block because of the fear of being perfect. Consequently, the more time they spend in front of the computer thinking, the less creative thoughts arise. As a result, nothing culminates into a reality; ideas don't translate into words.

### The key is to focus on getting things completed (done) asap
- Whenever you have a tight deadline to work with, focus on getting the task completed as soon as possible. Don’t think about the quality. 
- You’ll always be surprised to see your work completed before time. Since you have saved a lot of time, revise your work.
