# Problem-Pain Threshold
---
## Jot down...
- Most people are perfectly fine living with their problems. // This is a fact that sometime most designers are avoid.
- It‚Äôs easy to assume that once you‚Äôve identified the user‚Äôs problem, your job is done. You‚Äôre ready to build, get to work, create that magical solution that will get rid of your user‚Äôs problem // As a designer, this is so true. We likely to forget that sometimes problems are not a big deal. "It‚Äôs a big enough problem to complain about but not important enough for you to take the time to solve."
- That‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt quite crossed the problem-pain threshold that makes you want to act // True. And this is why we do avoid problem sometimes.

Three lessons helped cut through the noise and identify real opportunities.
- An obvious problem does not automatically make it a pain point.
	- an obviously painful problem to¬†_me_¬†does not make it a painful problem to the customer.
- Venting does not equal pain
	- Venting = give free expression to (a strong emotion).
	- When conduct an interview, try to get the real emotion that deeply insight customer's feeling whether they get the real pain of this problem that they want to solve or not‚Ä¶ If not, we may get the wrong sign. Because sometimes, interviewer just express some pain (venting) that they don't really like to solve it.
- A flawed solution still works // todo
