# Proof of keys Event
---
## Jot down...
What is it?
This reminds me of...
Why does it matter?

- Proof of Keys isn’t a new consensus algorithm for blockchain;
- One of the main goals of the event is to make sure that exchanges have the funds that they claim to have.
- After all, if they don’t, then there’s no guarantee that you actually have the coins you purchased on the exchange.

- In essence of the olden days, it’s a bank run.
	-  I described what a bank run basically is — one of the most famous bank run events occurred during the Great Depression, when citizens tried to withdraw their money from the banks as quickly as possible out of concern that the banks didn’t have enough money to give back to everyone, even though the banks claimed that they did.

### So what’s the point of Proof of Keys?
- As Trace Mayer stated in his tweet, “Not your keys; not your bitcoin.” Most crypto veterans, but far too few nocoiners (er… newcomers), understand that cryptocurrency stored on an exchange is, technically, owned by that exchange. Since the exchange has full control over the private keys (users have no access to them) they have the ability to do whatever they choose with the wallets and the crypto stored in them.
