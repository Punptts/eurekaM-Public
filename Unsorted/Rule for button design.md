# Rule for button design
---
## Jot down...
Buttons have the power to compel users to convert, to carry out an action. They are a middleman between the user and the product, and are charged with keeping the conversation between person and machine going.

1. Make it look clickable
	- Make it simple
	- Whenever a user uses any product, they must decode the meaning and function behind every single element in the interface.
2. Makt it easy to find and predict
	- Make it clear
	- Just like we are all used to a certain type of button design in terms of shapes, users also have an idea of where buttons should go in any given screen
3. Tell users what each button does. Don‚Äôt make them guess.
4. Size matters: have buttons people can actually click on
5. Don‚Äôt have a button for everything
6. Always provide feedback or risk user‚Äôs wrath
